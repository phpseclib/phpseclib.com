## Exceptions

Exceptions are thrown whenever a `bool(true)` or a `bool(false)` is insufficient to capture the error.

Consider `login()` for example. If `bool(true)` means that the login was successful then it stands to reason that `bool(false)` would mean that the login was _not_ successful. But what if there was a connection error in the login process? `bool(false)` _could_ be returned but then you couldn't distinguish between bad passwords (which is a bit of an oversimplification) or connection errors.

phpseclib throws exceptions for various errors:

- Connection Errors:
  - `\phpseclib3\Exception\UnableToConnectException`
  - `\phpseclib3\Exception\ConnectionClosedException`
  - `\UnexpectedValueException`

- Key Exchange Errors:
  - `\phpseclib3\Exception\NoSupportedAlgorithmsException`

- Authentication Errors:
  - `\phpseclib3\Exception\UnsupportedCurveException`
  - `\phpseclib3\Exception\UnsupportedAlgorithmException`

- Misc Errors:
  - `\RuntimeException`
  - `\phpseclib3\Exception\InsufficientSetupException`: thrown when you try to perform certain operations prior to being logged in

Depending on the situation an exception may or may not result in the SSH2 session being closed.

## isConnected(), isAuthenticated()

SSH2.php doesn't connect to a server after the constructor has been called - it makes the connection after one of the following methods is called:

- `login()`
- `getServerIdentification()`
- `getServerAlgorithms()`
- `getAlgorithmsNegotiated()`
- `getServerPublicHostKey()`

Calling `isConnected()` prior to any of these methods will return `bool(false)`. Premature closure of the session will also result in `isConnected()` returning `bool(false)`.

As of phpseclib 3.0.36 `isConnected()` optionally takes a `$level` parameter that can be used to select the method used to test if the connection is still opened or not. The various levels are:

- `isConnected(0)`. The default method.  Calls `feof()` on the socket object, which often means that the [server has closed the connection](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1321716/569976)
- `isConnected(1)`. Sends a SSH_MSG_IGNORE packet to the server.
- `isConnected(2)`. Sends a SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN packet to the server and then immediately closes the channel. Unlike `isConnected(1)` this method actually results in the server sending a response, however, some servers may limit the number of open channels that you can have, most notably, Cisco IOS Routers, which limit you to just one channel per session.

`isAuthenticated()` returns `bool(true)` only after you've been successfully logged in.

## getErrors(), getLastError()

`getErrors()` returns an array of all errors or messages that have been reported by the server at the SSH layer. `getLastError()` returns the most recent of these errors / messages.

`getSFTPErrors()` and `getLastSFTPError()` work similarily for the SFTP layer.

## getServerIdentification()

`getServerIdentification()` returns the server identification string. eg. `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.0p1 Ubuntu-6build1` or whatever.

## getBannerMessage()

Quoting [RFC4252 ยง 5.4. Banner Message](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4252#section-5.4), "_In some jurisdictions, sending a warning message before authentication may be relevant for getting legal protection.  Many UNIX machines, for example, normally display text from /etc/issue, use TCP wrappers, or similar software to display a banner before issuing a login prompt._"

## getLog()

Logging can be enabled by doing the following:

```php
define('NET_SSH2_LOGGING', SSH2::LOG_COMPLEX);
```

Several different logging options exist:

* `SSH2::LOG_SIMPLE`

   Can be obtained with `$ssh->getLog()`, which returns an array that, when passed through `print_r`, looks like [simple.txt](/logs/simple.txt).
* `SSH2::LOG_COMPLEX`.

   Can be obtained with `$ssh->getLog()`, which return a string that looks like [complex.txt](/logs/complex.txt). These logs are capped at 1 MiB.
* `SSH2::LOG_REALTIME`.

   Outputs, in realtime, logs that look like [complex.txt](/logs/complex.txt). `$ssh->getLog()` does nothing with this method.
* `SSH2::LOG_REALTIME_FILE`

   Logs data to a file realtime. Useful if your script is stalling or dying before you have a chance to call `$ssh->getLog()`.

   Used in conjunction with `define('NET_SSH2_LOG_REALTIME_FILENAME', 'log.txt');`.

   Log sizes are capped at 1 MiB. If they go over the log file will wrap around. Outside of the wrap around boundry the log files otherwise look like [complex.txt](/logs/complex.txt).

For all log types, if you're logging in with password authentication, whatever password you were using is replaced with 'password'. So if your password was actually '123456' (the [most common password in 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords)) it'll be replaced with 'password' in the logs.

## getSFTPLog()

SFTP logs can be enabled thusly:

```php
define('NET_SFTP_LOGGING', SFTP::LOG_COMPLEX);
```

The logging options are largely the same as they are for SSH2, with the caveat that there is no analog to `SSH2::LOG_REALTIME_FILE`.

## getServerAlgorithms()

If you get a "No compatible ... algorithms found" error it may be beneficial to do `$ssh->getServerAlgorithms()`.

You can additionally see the algorithms that were negotiated by doing `$ssh->getAlgorithmsNegotiated()`. See [Using a Custom Cipher Suite](connect.md#using-a-custom-cipher-suite) for more info.
